## Bill Tip Calculator Android App

Made with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

Following one of the best tutorials on the internet: [Kotlin Android Jetpack Compose](https://www.udemy.com/course/kotling-android-jetpack-compose-/)

I added onValueChange listener to the TextField, so that the tip is calculated once the textField loses focus.
